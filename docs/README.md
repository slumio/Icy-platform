## 1. Audience Demographics
Icy Platform allows you to filter and analyze influencers based on their audience demographics to ensure they match your target market.

- **Age**: Our platform matches influencers with the appropriate age group based on your campaign’s focus. Whether you're targeting Gen Z or an older demographic, we provide accurate data on an influencer’s audience.

## 2. Engagement Rate
Icy Platform gives you an in-depth look at influencers’ engagement metrics to ensure their audience is genuinely interested in their content.

- **Likes, Comments, Shares**: We emphasize engagement rates over follower count to ensure you’re choosing influencers with highly interactive audiences. This helps improve conversion rates.

## 3. Content Alignment
The Icy Platform ensures that the influencer’s content is in sync with your brand’s message.

- **Niche**: We match your brand with influencers who specialize in niches that are directly relevant to your industry. Whether you’re in the fashion, fitness, or tech space, we’ll help you find the best fit.

## 9. Budget
Icy Platform helps you choose influencers based on your budget and campaign goals.
